PIRATE THEME IDEAS
updated: 2/20/19
Movements: Left/Right, jump/crouch, shoot/attack
Possible Timer for game/level: (possible reasons for timer or not?)

Anything with a pirate hat could be a possible character 
Wep: Hand cannon, throwing beer, & knife of somesort (melee attacks?) 
Goal of game: To get to the other ship and not die,

Possible Backgrounds: Clouds up top sand on ground with barrels(possible 
obst.) 

Health system? How do we die? 3 hits? 3 hearts? One life? 
Beer as health, break (melee or range) barrels to get beer.

Crabs, sea creatures, other pirates  (boss at end of level?) parrots, 
Skeleton pirates (with rag gang related) squid, octopus, shark breaches 
dock, jumping fish, 
Turtle shell jumps to get past water (maybe probably not)
Rolling barrels that you need to dodge or jump over to not lose beer. 
(maybe code animation for monkeys throwing or pushing barrels) 


Themed colors maybe (easy) 

Goals: maybe different pickup wep. Powerups? Jumping to kill, coin 
pickup.
Diff levels, dock, islands, rescue hostage (maybe)

Phone Interface:
	On the left : left and right arrows
